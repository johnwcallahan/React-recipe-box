# React-recipe-box

#### Dynamic recipe storage app - create and edit recipes, then save them in your browser's local storage. 

Created as a project for FreeCodeCamp, fulfilling the following user stories: 

1. I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
2. I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
3. I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
4. I can edit these recipes.
5. I can delete these recipes.
6. All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.
